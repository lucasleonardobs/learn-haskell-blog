# Exercises:

1. Add types for all of the functions we created until now

2. Change the implementation of the HTML functions we built to use el instead

3. Add a couple more functions for defining paragraphs and headings:

    1. p_ which uses the tag <p\> for paragraphs
    2. h1_ which uses the tag <h1\> for headings
4. Replace our Hello, world! string with richer content, use h1_ and p_. We can append HTML strings created by h1_ and p_ using the append operator <>.

> Bonus: rewrite a couple of functions using lambda functions, just for fun!
